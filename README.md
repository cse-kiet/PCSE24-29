TITLE: PROPOSED METHODOLOGY FOR SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION

ABSTRACT: â€œLanguage shapes the way we think, and determines what we can think about. Sign language, too, makes an enormous difference in the way we can think." - Temple Grandin 
Sign language is also known as a form of nonverbal communication that relies on the visual-manual modality. One popular way that people with hearing disabilities interact with each other is through gestures, and there are a variety of options possible for their interaction, including sign language. In this paper, by using video or hand gesture input, the device can recognize various alphabetical sequences with a color background provided using American Sign Language. Different parameters and feature extraction methods were used in the experiments to improve the model's detection accuracy. Overall, the findings highlight the promise of machine learning methodologies for sign language identification as well as the importance of developing precise and effective systems in narrowing the communication 
divide between the auditors and the deaf.
